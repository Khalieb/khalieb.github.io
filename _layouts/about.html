            When I was 8, my parents brought home a 386 processor computer with Windows 3.1. I was immediately perplexed by this TV I could interact with. So one day, when they were both gone, I took off the case and peaked inside. This left me even more perplexed. I knew then, at least in the abstract, what I wanted to do with my life.  
            </p>
            <p class="leftp">
            I have been developing professionally for just over 10 years. My main focus during this time has been working on backend distributed systems. I have worked with small to large in scale systems, data, and traffic. This what I always dreamed of doing and will continue to do it whether someone is paying me or not.
            </p>

            <p class="leftp">
			I would break up my time as a developer into two categories: B.V. (Before Video) & A.V. (After Video). Everything BV is not really worth being chiseled into a tablet. If I had to though, there was a failed startup, a security company, an internship, and maybe some web development. This allowed me to gain experience with both frontend and backend. 
            </p>

            <p class="leftp">
			In the years A.V. (After Video) 0-4 I worked at Brightcove on Dynamic Delivery. I have experience with DASH and HLS Delivery for VOD and SSAI. I have worked with various ad tech formats, e.g. VAST, DFP. Worked with MP4 and TS containers to repackage media segments. I have also worked with CDN providers like Fastly and Akamai. In the last four years, I've had the opportunity to touch most aspects of video. Working on the delivery team with customers around the world has also provided me the chance to work at large scale.

            <p class="leftp">
			Go has been my primary language for the last five years. If you want to talk generics and error handling, there will probably be a hacker news article tomorrow to which you may comment. If you really want to talk about it or perhaps about video tech, I can be reached at c@khalieb.com.
