            <p>
             I have worked on Dynamic Delivery at Brightcove for the last four years. I have experience with DASH and HLS Delivery for VOD and SSAI.  
             I have worked with various ad tech formats, e.g. VAST, DFP. Worked with MP4 and TS containers to repackage media segments. I have 
             also worked with CDN providers like Fastly and Akamai. In the last four years, I have had the opportunity to touch most aspects of video. I would
             like to continue to do so. 
            </p>

            <p>
             Go has been my primary language for the last five years. If you want to talk generics and error handling, there will probably be a hacker news 
             article tomorrow to which you may comment. If you really want to talk about it or perhaps about video tech, I can be reached at c@khalieb.com.

            <p>My thoughts are not my own.</p>
